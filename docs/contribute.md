The site is hosted on Github. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/uclaGEA/uclaGEA.github.io/), make edits, commit, and submit a pull request to have it merged.
All pages are written in markdown and use Just The Docs (JTD) for formatting. JTD uses particular YAML headers.
You can either find these on other pages or use the [Just The Docs documentation](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/).

Start a new markdown file. You can use another page as a template. Put the page in a folder if you want it to have a parent.



-------

[^1]: I think one needs ruby because the just-the-docs theme is distributed as a ruby gem. Have not tried running `jekyll serve` directly without ruby.
