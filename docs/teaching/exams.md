* Where can I find a scanner?
  - If you want to make photocopies of exams (e.g., so you can hand back all students a copy of their scantrons after a test) you can do so in the front office copy room.

* How do I make copies when instructed by the professor?
  - We can do this ourselves (and it is preferred that we do). The code to the copy machine is 22365. (Don't have to ask front office!) Once you have figured out the settings you can stack the originals on the top and let the machine make copies of them.
  
* How do I use scantrons?
  - When bringing in your scantrons to be run off, please make sure to schedule an appointment at least two days prior to requested day/time. You can schedule an appointment by either (a) phone, call (310) 825-6939 , (b) email: eip@oid.ucla.edu or (c) go to [this website]("https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/test-scoring") (their preference is the last optionâ€”you can also fill out their request form online rather than in their office, so speeds things up a bit). Additional information about using the scantrons can be found [here]("https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/test-scoring").
  
* How do we administer CAE tests?
  - If a student is registered with the Center for Accessible Education Office (CAE), they will often take tests at a different location than the rest of the class. Students with the CAE have their own proctors.<p>The professor will be notified by email and will have to sign online that they are received the information. It happens that TAs are also notified. Before the test day, the professor will have to send the CAE office the test and CAE staff will prepare the test for the students. If there is a schedule collision (e.g. because the student will have more time to do the test and they are doing multiple tests that day) the student might do the test later than the rest of the class.
