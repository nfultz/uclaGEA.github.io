* Can I get reimbursed for conferences?
  -  After students have advanced to candidacy, they are eligible for Conference Travel funding once every fiscal year [July 1 through June 30]. A student can be reimbursed for up to $500 if they present at a conference or up to $300 if they attend a conference without presenting. Students interested in utilizing this funding should reach out to the Graduate Advisors for details before they travel.
  - Before 2021: The department will provide funds to cover a variety of expenses (including registration fees) for students who are invited to present at a qualified academic/professional conference during academic year 2020-2021 (up to $700 if invited for a regular presentation, up to $400 if invited for a poster presentation, and possibly a smaller amount just for attendance). To apply, please send an email to grad-office@econ.ucla.edu with the invitation letter for the conference. The subject line should be "Lewis L. Clarke Graduate Fellowship for Conference Presentations‚Äù.  We will accept applications throughout the year for any conferences that will be held between July 2020 and June 2021. (Note: The current department travel support ($300/year) will be discontinued and replaced by this fellowship for 2020-2021).  Funding will be awarded on a reimbursement basis.  Students who are awarded funding will need to submit the necessary receipts to Grace Fransisca soon after the conference concludes.
