# GEA Wiki

This wiki is the "single source of truth" for all things related to the UCLA Economics PhD program, 
collectively maintained by the graduate students.[^1] It serves as a companion to the department website
and Graduate Student Handbook (which are maintained by department staff and faculty), to answer 
graduate student questions about processes, procedures, and resources. If you learn something about 
the department that should be written down, submit a pull request. See [How to Contribute](contribute) for more details.
