      <h4 class="subhead1">About</h4>
      The Graduate Economics Association at UCLA has three stated goals:
      <ol>
        <li>To encourage transparent communication between the faculty, the administration, and the students.</li>
        <li>To boost intra-departmental relations</li>
        <li>To help students pass exams, finish projects, and stay healthy.</li>
      </ol>
      To this end, the GEA tries to organize events that facilitate interactions between students as well as between students. About once a month, the GEA holds a Friday happy hour that allows students to gather informally and chat. We also hold a
      series of PACT-12s (Professors and Cookies Time at 12) off and on through the school year, where we invite professors from the department to come and talk to grad students about their research as well as share any advice they may have.

	  <h4 class="subsubhead"><u>Contact Us</u></h4>
      The UCLA Graduate Economics Association can be reached via email at econ.ucla [at] gmail.com. We would like to encourage students from other institutions to reach out to us so that we can trade ideas. Prospective students should also feel free
      to contact us if they are looking for information about applying to the PhD program. Finally, we would be happy to hear from grad students at other departments at UCLA for planning inter-departmental events. <br><br>
