# UCLA GEA WEBSITE

This is the website for the UCLA Graduate Economics Association. If you would like to join the organization and help with building/maintaining the website just contact one of the people already in the organization or the GEA presidents. 

Right now tasks that we are working on related to the website can be found in the TODO.txt file. If you would like to contribute you can try and do something off the todo list. Alternatively, if you'd like to see something changed/added/removed, you can also suggest a change by adding an item to the todo list. Then if it's a good idea someone will get to it eventually hopefully.
