      <h2>Questions about TA'ing </h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Q: Where can I find a scanner?</b> <br> <b>A:</b> If you want to make photocopies of exams (e.g., so you can hand back all students a copy of their scantrons after a test) you can do so in the front office copy room.</li>
        <li><b>Q: How do I make copies when instructed by the professor?</b> <br> <b>A:</b> We can do this ourselves (and it is preferred that we do). The code to the copy machine is 22365. (Don't have to ask front office!) Once you have figured out the settings you can stack the originals on the top and let the machine make copies of them.</li>
        <li><b>Q: How do I use scantrons?</b> <br><b>A:</b> When bringing in your scantrons to be run off, please make sure to schedule an appointment at least two days prior to requested day/time. You can schedule an appointment by either (a) phone, call (310) 825-6939 , (b) email: eip@oid.ucla.edu or (c) go to <a href="https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/test-scoring"> this website</a> (their preference is the last option—you can also fill out their request form online rather than in their office, so speeds things up a bit). Additional information about using the scantrons can be found <a href= "https://www.teaching.ucla.edu/test-scoring">here.</a>
        <li><b>Q: How do we administer CAE tests?</b><br><b>A:</b> If a student is registered with the Center for Accessible Education Office (CAE), they will often take tests at a different location than the rest of the class. Students with the CAE have their own proctors.<p>The professor will be notified by email and will have to sign online that they are received the information. It happens that TAs are also notified. Before the test day, the professor will have to send the CAE office the test and CAE staff will prepare the test for the students. If there is a schedule collision (e.g. because the student will have more time to do the test and they are doing multiple tests that day) the student might do the test later than the rest of the class.</p>

      <h2>Questions about Research/Ph.D proccess</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Q: How does the "get out of jail free" card work for first year comps?</b><br><b>A:</b> From the graduate program handbook: A student can be exempt from one comprehensive exam if the student receives at least a B in all three of the first-year core courses in that sequence, AND achieves a minimum GPA of 3.3 in that field. If a student meets this requirement in more than one sequence, they still have the option to take all three exams. They can choose which exam grades they would like to use to satisfy the requirement after they receive the exam results.</li>
        <li><b>Q: What courses do I need to enroll in for TA'ing?</b><br> <b>A:</b> During [at least] the first year of teaching you will have to enroll in Econ375 and Econ495 every quarter. You should sign up for 2-4 credits. Do not worry about schedule clashes, it is a formality to have some time-slot for each class</li>
        <li><b>Q: How does the breadth option work in second year?</b><br><b>A: </b><i>From graduate program handbook and emails with Chiara and Grace: </i> Instead of doing a third field there is the breadth option. The requirements are that the breadth option contains 3 courses of which at least one course has to be in history, and the two other courses have to be from two different fields and outside of your other two fields.  An illustration of the last criterium: E.g., the macro field has four courses to choose from. If you take three to fulfill the field requirement for macro you cannot use the remaining course in your breadth option, it has to be outside of your field. Exception: If you are doing history as a field you can still use the breadth option, you just would take three courses in three different fields from fields other than history and your second field.</p></li>
        <li><b>Q: Can I get reimbursed for conferences?</b><br><b>A: </b>
        <i>For 2020-2021:</i>The department will provide funds to cover a variety of expenses (including registration fees) for students who are invited to present at a qualified academic/professional conference during academic year 2020-2021 (up to $700 if invited for a regular presentation, up to $400 if invited for a poster presentation, and possibly a smaller amount just for attendance).
        <p>To apply, please send an email to grad-office@econ.ucla.edu with the invitation letter for the conference. The subject line should be "Lewis L. Clarke Graduate Fellowship for Conference Presentations”.  We will accept applications throughout the year for any conferences that will be held between July 2020 and June 2021. (Note: The current department travel support ($300/year) will be discontinued and replaced by this fellowship for 2020-2021).  Funding will be awarded on a reimbursement basis.  Students who are awarded funding will need to submit the necessary receipts to Grace Fransisca soon after the conference concludes.</p>
        <p><i>For beyond:</i> After students have advanced to candidacy, they are eligible for Conference Travel funding once every fiscal year [July 1 through June 30]. A student can be reimbursed for up to $500 if they present at a conference or up to $300 if they attend a conference without presenting. Students interested in utilizing this funding should reach out to the Graduate Advisors for details before they travel.</p>﻿</li>
